## Description

In this course, I've delved into the fundamentals of data science, learning how to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively. The materials here showcase my journey through understanding and applying key concepts in the field.

## Topics Covered

Some of the topics covered in this course include:

- Data manipulation with pandas
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Introduction to machine learning algorithms using sklearn
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis techniques

## Learning Outcomes
- Explore a data set to determine whether and how it might illuminate questions of interest.
- Define and operationalize a research question such that a data analysis could produce meaningful knowledge.
- Use best practices to carry out analyses in a documented, reproducible, and efficient fashion.
- Present the results of a data analysis with appropriate visuals and written argument.
- Identify weaknesses in a data analysis and assess their impact on the correctness and utility of the results.
- Assess ethical implications of an analysis in terms of both classical human subject research ethics and contemporary concerns such as fairness and bias.
- Understand the space of data science techniques and applications, and relate future learning to this framework.
